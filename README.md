# Mephistopheles
A Visual Programming Language

## TODO

- [ ] fix recursive direction ```const localGroup = this.getGroup(this,false);```
- [ ] promote ```const serializables =  'id x y w h'.split(' ');``` to OOP

---

- [ ] Port Control widget inside every window that controls window anchors
- [ ] Junction
- [ ] Function Node With A Code Editor
- [ ] Selection Manager
- [ ] any and all are not automatically collected check for manual garbage collection attempts
- [ ] this.pipe.on needs to be destructible
- [ ] layout manager manage and cleanup may need work
- [ ] Convert Selection To Window (Make A Component)
- [ ] Restore iframe (just use Foreign)
- [ ] Non-Selectable Text Everywhere

- [ ] Face Toolbox

---

- [x] Remove Pipe When Window Is Destroyed
- [x] Select Connection
- [x] Delete Component
- [x] Re-sizable Components
- [x] Ports
- [x] Port Node
- [x] Pipe
- [x] Editor
- [x] Terminal
- [x] HTML Window (possibly for svelte)
- [x] Cascading Zoom
- [x] Labels must monitor transform stack from their placement up.
- [x] .s is not working with laut manager and the anomaly in pane.
- [x] Nested Transforms
- [x] Add component loading to Root Window
- [x] Switch from JSON to XML

## Laws
- Parent Components Sets The Scene: the child must ass it's .g to the scene (add its svg group to scene set by parent)
- All Controls Have Ports: a control no matter how large or small can paint ports.
- method naming scheme: add + Window + Component = action Parent Class + Class Of Object
- all Controls have this.anchors where named anchors must be stored
- Externally, you may not interact with object's properties directly, only via methods (creating an api, and taking care of minot config)
- root container always has a node, node always has an origin, origin has a root

## Name

```Me:``` Hey SkyShadow (The AI chose that name for it self), help me find a name for my visual programming language. Give me a list of powerful names, that may still be available for registration.

(Mephistopheles was available, I jumped in part because of the cat in Broadway's "Cats")

```Me:``` Good job!, Mephistopheles was in deed available, the program will now be known as Mephistopheles and accessed from https://github.com/catpea/mephistopheles The name hides the meaning "not loving light", which is exactly how programmers feel. And I am never even going to make a light theme for the UI, only dark mode will ever be supported. Hey, not loving light, is of course a stab at education, and thus ensuring that people remain poor an easy to manipulate. My program actually aims to fix that, it brings enlightenment to code, and functional education to young students.

```SkyShadow:``` That sounds like a fascinating and impactful project with a richly symbolic name! Using the name "Mephistopheles" is not only memorable but also sets a strong thematic tone. The exclusive use of a dark mode interface aligns well with the name's connotation and adds to the overall aesthetic and experience. Best of luck with your programming language, Mephistopheles. It seems poised to make a significant contribution to education and enlightenment in coding. Happy coding, and may your project bring much-needed light to those it reaches!
